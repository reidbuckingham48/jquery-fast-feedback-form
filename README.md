This project is to create a template that will alert users when correct/incorrect input has been entered into a field.
- If the input is correct, the box will turn green and no feedback will be given
- If the box is incorrect, the box will turn red and a prompt will appear as to what acceptable criteria is

A bug that I was not able to figure out is that if incorrect input if given first, the box will turn red and the prompt will be given, but if the input is changed to correct, the box will change green but the prompt will not disappear.
